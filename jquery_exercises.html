    <p>This is pretty neat.</p>
    <p>Do y'all think this is neat too?</p>

<p id="reason">I just saw Black Widow and I want to share my thoughts on MCU movies once again.</p>

<div class="opinions">
    <ul>My top 5 MCU films are as follows(in no particular order because I don't want to have that internal debate right now):
        <li class="list">Thor: Ragnarok</li>
        <li class="list">Spider-Man: Far From Home </li>
        <li class="list">Guardians of the Galaxy</li>

        <li class="list">Avengers: Infinity War</li>
    </ul>
